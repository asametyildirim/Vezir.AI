# Vezir.AI
Vezir.ai employs the method of reinforcement learning to develop a model capable of learning and playing chess. The fundamental objective of the project is to enable an AI model, initially devoid of any knowledge about the game, to comprehend and engage in chess starting from the ground up.


I won't release the project's code as open-source until a stable model has been developed, as I am endeavoring to create a core model on my own and do not wish to receive assistance during this process. However, I will share the games played by Vezir.ai here with every update. :)

### Day One:

**Note:** It appears to be attempting invalid moves at least 300 times before each actual move. It seems like it hasn't learned how the pieces move or grasped the rules of chess..
